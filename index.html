                    <p>Arknights takes place in the dystopian world of Terra. 
                        Terra may seem initially similar to our Earth, 
                        a modern world with a relatively similar level 
                        of technology, perhaps slightly more futuristic. 
                        However, its inhabitants, the "Ancients", sport animalistic traits. 
                        The world is constantly devastated by Catastrophes, ecological disasters of various sorts, 
                        forcing the world's inhabitants to adopt a nomadic life through nomadic cities. 
                        Along with the Catastrophes came Originium, a black crystalline mineral left behind in the aftermath of catastrophes. 
                        Originium is widely used by the Terrans as a source of energy, engineering materials, 
                        and catalyzes magic-like powers known as Originium Arts. 
                        However, exposure to Originium leads to a "terminal disease" known as Oripathy, 
                        which has become a pandemic plaguing all of Terra. Oripathy is not easily transmissible, 
                        at least until the death and crystallization of its victims. Nevertheless, 
                        those stricken with Oripathy are known as Infected and suffer heavy oppression and marginalization across the entire world.

                    <p>Those who have played tower defense(TD) games will be 
                        familiar with Arknights' gameplay: the player must keep enemies from reaching a certain goal by using "towers".
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    However, unlike most <code>TD</code> games, Arknights is different by 
                    adding RPG elements and assigning mechanics and skills to each tower. 
                    A tower is called an Operator and can be deployed either to attack or block enemies. 
                    To deploy an Operator one must have the same number of Deployment Points(DP) required by each Operator.
                    Their are two ways to accumulate <code>DP</code>, one is passive accumulation per second and the other is through the skills of some Operators.
                    Enemies take various uncommon paths to reach their goals with a wide variety of enemy types and behaviors. 
                    Each map may introduce hazards to the operators for a more challenging and strategic gameplay.

                    <p>
                        Operators are the characters used in battle by the players. 
                        They serve as "towers" the player places in locations around the battlefield to prevent the enemies 
                        from reaching the objective.

                    <p>
                        Each Operator in Arknights belong to one of eight classes which determines how they function, 
                        with each class having their subclasses that specializes the Operator's abilities

                        They're the cheapest, and they get access to <code>DP</code> recovery skills. 
                        Their stats are lower than other melee operators but they help you deploy the rest of your team faster. 
                        Best in fending of weaker enemies at the start and will be replaced with an operator best suited for the job.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Casters have shorter range, slower <code>ATSPD</code> and higher <code>DP</code> cost compared to Snipers,

                    <p>
                        This class has operators in the most niche roles and would depend on the 
                        players knowledge to know which map to use the operators in this category. Operators on this 
                        subclass have diverse skillsets.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Specialist subclasses</h5>

                <div class="doc-element">
                    <p>
                        Variety is encouraged. 
                        Relying on a single Operator class and/or archetype is not enough to clear most operations. 
                        Make a diverse team to handle any and every possibility instead.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Rarity does not always make a difference. 
                        While it is true that higher-rarity Operators tend to be superior to lower-rarity ones, 
                        the latter can still be viable in general situations and useful as reserves in certain situations 
                        due to their low DP cost and the fact that they are cheaper to build.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        DP cost efficiency matters. Utilizing powerful Operators, usually, those of higher rarity may be tempting, 
                        but note that most of them have high <code>DP</code> costs.  Add several 3★ and/or 4★ to the mix. Some stages have <code>DP</code> economy as a challenge of its own. 
                        Make sure operators are worth what they cost to you and consider that sometimes you could solve the situation with someone much cheaper.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Don't be afraid to fail, and use your drill plans. 
                        Theorizing is all well and good, but practice makes perfect. 
                        It is difficult, or even sometimes impossible to know what to expect out of a stage. 
                        Failure is not truly a failure, but a learning experience allowing you to remediate the flaws of your strategy. 
                        Different players learn at different speeds, and it is truly possible to improve as a player by simply trying. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Use the map previews! Looking at a map's layout is a great, 
                        if not necessary step to see which team you can attempt to bring, 
                        how many chokepoints you will have to hold, and what might be in store for you. Pay attention, 
                        for example, to the presence of Aerial Incursion Points that signify you will need an operator that can hit drones.

                        Remember to have fun. 
                        If you find yourself bored by succeeding at stages using cookie-cutter strategies, 
                        try to make your own fun and spice up the game by challenging yourself to certain self-imposed rules, 
                        or by trying out your more underappreciated operators. Remember, variety is encouraged, 
                        and what low-rarity operators lack in firepower they tend to make up for in specialization. 
                        Arknights is a game, it should not be a chore.
